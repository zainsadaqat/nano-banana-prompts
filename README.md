## üìö Learning & Education

```
Explain [COMPLEX CONCEPT] using only common words a 12-year-old would know, then give a real-world analogy.
```

**Sample Result:**
**Concept:** Blockchain
**Simple Explanation:** A blockchain is like a notebook that everyone in class shares. When someone writes something new, everyone gets a copy. You can't erase or change what's already written without everyone noticing. This makes it really hard to cheat or lie about what happened.

**Real-world Analogy:** It's like a classroom where every student keeps the exact same diary, and they all check each other's entries to make sure no one is making stuff up.

2. **Security:** Is user input properly sanitized? (XSS prevention, input validation)
3. **Accessibility:** Are interactive elements keyboard accessible? (Tab navigation, ARIA labels)
4. **Error Handling:** Are async operations wrapped in try-catch? (API calls, file operations)
5. **Readability:** Are component names descriptive and functions under 20 lines? (Clear intent, single responsibility)

---

### üêõ Debug Strategy Generator
**Prompt:**
```
I'm getting [ERROR MESSAGE]. Give me a 3-step debugging strategy starting with the most likely cause.
```

**Sample Result:**
**Error:** "Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"

**3-Step Debug Strategy:**
1. **Check data source** (Most likely): Console.log the variable before .map() - is it actually an array? Is the API call completing before render?
2. **Add safe fallback** (Quick fix): Use optional chaining and default to empty array: `data?.map()` or `(data || []).map()`
3. **Trace data flow** (Root cause): Follow the data from API ‚Üí state ‚Üí component props to find where it becomes undefined
